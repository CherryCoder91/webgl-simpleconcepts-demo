The example is programmed to use a software renderer as a fallback to webgl and hardware accelleration. 

The two libraries CanvasRenderer and Projector achieve this. There is also some minimal logic in the webgl controller to apply its use.


The demo illustrates the posibility of html dom elements interacting with the webgl render area.
